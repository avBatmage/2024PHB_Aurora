		<description>
			<p>Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened mercenaries—as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and defying it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fighters master various weapon techniques, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A FIGHTER</h4>
			<p>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p>
			<p class="indent">You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death's embrace.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution. Second, choose the soldier background.</p>
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>

		<description>
			<p><em>3rd-Level Feature</em></p>
			<p>You have learned to cast spells. See the Player's Handbook for rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Eldritch Knight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Cantrips.</b></p>
			<p class="indent">You know two cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list. Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of this feature's cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you reach level 10 in this class, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Spell Slots.</b></p>
			<p class="indent">The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of level 1 and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</b></p>
			<p class="indent">You prepare a list of spells of level 1 and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 spells from the Wizard spell list, two of which must be from the Abjuration and Evocation schools of magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Fighter levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Wizard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Fighter, your list of prepared spells can include six Wizard spells of levels 1 and 2, in any combination.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Changing your Prepared Spells.</b> Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the Wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Spellcasting Ability.</b> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Eldritch Knight spells.</p>			
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			</center>
			<p class="indent"><b>Spellcasting Focus.</b> You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this subclass.</p>
